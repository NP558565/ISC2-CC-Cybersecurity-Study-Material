<h2 id="understanding-risks">Understanding risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Internal Risks: Arise from <strong>within</strong> the organization.</li>
<li>External Risks: Arise from <strong>outside</strong> the organization.</li>
<li>Multiparty Risks: Affect <strong>more than one</strong> organization.</li>
<li>Intellectual property therft : poses a risk to <strong>knowleage-based</strong> organizations.</li>
<li>Software license compliance: issues risk fines and legal action.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h2>
<p>Risk assessment <strong>identifies</strong> and <strong>triages</strong> risks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threats</strong>: are external forces that jeopardize security.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong>: are weaknesses in your security controls.</li>
<li><strong>Risks</strong> : are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Risks rank by <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Likelihood</strong>: is the probability a risk will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: is the amount of damamge a risk will cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>we have two different categories of technique that we can use to assess the likelihood and Impact of a risk.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Qualitative Risk Assessment: Uses subjective ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact.</p>
<p> ![[Qualitative Risk assessment.png]]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quantitative Risk Assessment: Uses Objective numeric ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="risk-treatment">Risk treatment</h2>
<p>Risk treatment analyzes and implements possible responses to control risk.</p>
<p>Risk Treatment Options</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk avoidance<ul>
<li>Risk avoidance changes business practices to make a risk irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk transference<ul>
<li>Risk treatment analyzes and implements possible responses to control risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk mitigation<ul>
<li>Risk mitigation reduces the likelihood or impact of a risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk acceptance<ul>
<li>Risk acceptance is the choice to continue operations in the face of a risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="selecting-security-controls">Selecting security controls</h2>
<p>Security controls reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk and help identify issues.</p>
<p>Two different ways of security controls</p>
<ol>
<li>Control Purpose<ol>
<li>Preventive<ul>
<li>Preventive controls stop a security issue from occcurring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detective<ul>
<li>Detective controls identify security issues requiring investigation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrective<ul>
<li>Recovery controls remediate security issues that have occurred.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Control Mechanism<ol>
<li>Technical<ul>
<li>use technology to achieve control objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Administrative<ul>
<li>use processes to achieve control objectives.</li>

<li>Physical<ul>
<li>Impact the physical world.</li>

<h2 id="configuration-managment">Configuration managment</h2>
<p>Tracks specific device settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Baselines: Provide a configuration snapshot.</li>
<li>Versioning: Assigns numbers to each varsion.</li>
<li>Diagrams serve as important configuration artifacts.</li>
<li>Standardize Device Configurations<ul>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>IP adderessing schemes</li>
