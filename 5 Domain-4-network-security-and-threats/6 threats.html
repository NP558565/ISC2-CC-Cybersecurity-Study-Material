<th>Vulnerability</th>
<th>Summary</th>

</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Spoofing</td>
<td>An attack where a malicious actor disguises their identity to gain unauthorized access to a network or system. This can include IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, and email spoofing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Phishing</td>
<td>An attack where a malicious actor sends a fraudulent message, often through email or social media, with the goal of tricking the recipient into giving up sensitive information or installing malware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DOS/DDOS</td>
<td>Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve overwhelming a server or network with traffic, making it unable to handle legitimate requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Virus</td>
<td>A type of malware that infects a system. Viruses can damage or destroy data, and can spread to other systems through infected files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worm</td>
<td>Similar to a virus, a worm is a self-replicating malware that can spread across a network without the need for a host file or program.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trojan</td>
<td>A type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program in order to trick users into installing it. Trojans can be used to steal data, install additional malware, or take control of a system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>On-path attack</td>
<td>An attack where a malicious actor intercepts and modifies network traffic between two systems. This can include Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks or Session Hijacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Side-channel</td>
<td>An attack where a malicious actor exploits weaknesses in a system&#39;s physical properties, such as power consumption or electromagnetic radiation, to extract sensitive information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)</td>
<td>A targeted attack where a malicious actor gains persistent access to a network or system, often through spear-phishing or other social engineering tactics. APTs can be used for espionage, data theft, or sabotage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Insider</td>
<td>An attack where a trusted individual with access to a system or network abuses that access for personal gain or to cause harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Malware</td>
<td>A broad term for any type of malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans, and other types of malicious code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ransomware</td>
<td>A type of malware that encrypts a user&#39;s files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware can be distributed through email, malicious websites, or other means.</td>
